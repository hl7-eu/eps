| **Alerts content status**                  | C           | Equivalent      | section.emptyReason | Same purpose; EU PS model follows the IPS FHIR representation (emptyReason). |
| **Alert**                                  | M           | Equivalent      | Alert                           | Core entry element; represents a patient alert or flag.                                              |
