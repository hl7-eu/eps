# Immunization (IPS) - International Patient Summary Implementation Guide v2.0.0

## Resource Profile: Immunization (IPS) 

 
This profile represents the constraints applied to the Immunization resource by the International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR Implementation Guide. A record of an immunization is represented in the patient summary as an instance of an Immunization resource constrained by this profile. 
It describes the event of a patient being administered a vaccination or a record of a vaccination as reported by a patient, a clinician or another party. 

**Usages:**

* Use this Profile: [Bundle (IPS)](StructureDefinition-Bundle-uv-ips.md)
* Refer to this Profile: [Composition (IPS)](StructureDefinition-Composition-uv-ips.md)
* Examples for this Profile: [Immunization/75680](Immunization-75680.md)
* CapabilityStatements using this Profile: [IPS Server Capability Statement](CapabilityStatement-ips-server.md)
