			<strong>Note about the Functional Status Section</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
      The Functional Status model used by the (Xt-EHR) European Patient Summary identifies, as part of that model, a set of assessment results that appear to be more appropriately represented by an <strong>Observation</strong> rather than by a <strong>ClinicalImpression</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
      However, Observation is not included among the allowed target resources for this section.
		</p>

		<p>Considering that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>in most cases this section is textual, and</li>
			<li>further analysis is needed to increase the maturity of this section,</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
      it has been agreed, for this version, to maintain conformance with the IPS.
		</p>

		<p>
      Adopters should nevertheless be aware that this section may be subject to substantial changes in future versions.
